Look Below for a section entitled "progress"
if you would like to know where I am along this project
=========================
Description:
This started as a simple Fork of CyanogenMod but will become a port of CHAos (Chameleon OS) for the Nook Tablet. Hopefully
The project will take on a more fruitful life and more features will come along, making it a CHAos+ and from there turning
in to it's own Custom Rom focused on the "Custom" and not worried about being a Stock clone! Yes lets play friendly with 
android, but why not be different and create amazing products while we are at it?

If you would like to join in this effort Message me at webmaster@thaicares.com
Hopefully I will see it and respond if not - don't worry I am not the best at keeping up to date on it.

========================
Progress~
  Status: There is now a README.md for this fork
  
  Still currently a basic fork with ONLY a README.md added which also serves little purpose
